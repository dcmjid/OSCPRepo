<title>MSF Exit Functions</title>
</head><body>Many MSF payloads have an EXITFUNC variable that can be defined. Typically, there are two main functions: ExitProcess and ExitThread. <br/>
<br/>
ExitProcess will shut down the whole process (including parent) when it is terminated. This means that the service also cannot be re-exploited until the process has been restarted. The service will also typically "hang" because it is processing the exploit code and nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
ExitThread will only kill the thread of the process that was created. This means that the service can be re-exploited because the exploit will create a separate child thread. This also has the added benefit of the service (usually) continuing to operate normally for other users.<br/>
