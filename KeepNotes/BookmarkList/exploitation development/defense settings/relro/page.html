<title>RELRO</title>
</head><body>RELRO stands for Relocation Read-Only. This means that the headers in the bindary, which need to be writable during startup (to allow the dynamic linker to load and link stuff like shared libraries) are marked as "read-only" when the linker is done doing its magic (but before the application itself is launched).<br/>
<br/>
Difference between Partial RELRO and Full RELRO is that the Global Offset Table (and Procedure Linkage Table) which act as kind-of process-specific lookup tables for symbols (names that need to point to locations elsewhere in the application or even in loaded shared libraries) are marked read-only too in the Full RELRO. Downsize of this is that lazy binding (only resolving those symbols the first time for faster startup) is not possible anymore.<br/>
