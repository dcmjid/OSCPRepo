<title>PIE</title>
</head><body>PIE is Position Independent Executable. A "NO PIE" application tells the loader which virtual address it should use (and keeps its memory layout quite static). Combined with in-kernel ASLR, PIE applications have a more diverge memory organization, making attacks that rely on memory structure more difficult (ie, no jumping to shellcode, have to use bruteforce, RET, or calculate on the fly)<br/>
<br/>
Attacks against this application know up-front how the virtual memory for this application is (partially organized). <br/>
<br/>
Essentially, PIE is ASLR for the application only. </body></html>
