<title>Canary</title>
</head><body>Canary is a certain value put on the stack and validated before that functino is left again. Leaving a function means that the "previous" address (location in the application right before the function was called) is retrieved from this stack and jumped to. If the canary value is not correct, then the stack might have been overwritten / corrupted, so the applicatino is immediately stopped.</body></html>
