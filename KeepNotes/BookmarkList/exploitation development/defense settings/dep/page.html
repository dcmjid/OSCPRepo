<title>DEP</title>
</head><body>DEP is 'similar' to Linux NX.<br/>
DEP is a set of hardware, and software, technologies that perform additional checks on memory, to help prevent malicious code from running on a system. The primary benefit of DEP is to help prevent code execution from data pages, by raising an exception, when execution occurs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the application is compiled with DEP support, when looking at modules loaded in memory, you need to identify which modules are loaded with which permissions. This will determine where you can read, where you can write, and where you can execute. </body></html>
