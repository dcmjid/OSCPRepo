<title>NX</title>
</head><body>NX or non-execute means that the application, when loaded in memory, does not allow any of its segments to be both writable and executable. The idea here is that writable memory should never be executed. <br/>
<br/>
NX can be defeated if you are able to craft your own memory space and set it to executable. Alternatively, if you can mark another writable space as executable. Either case requires being able to make the correct function calls and calculating the address space (beginning and end) correctly. </body></html>
