Firstorder Tool<br/>
So we created a tool called firstorder, which is written in Python. With given PCAP file, firstorder can extract key features of the network such as most used ports, most used user-agent values, server headers, how many different machines out there etc. According to these identified data, it automatically configures Empire’s listener.<br/>
<br/>
You can check the usage on it’s Github page: <a href="https://github.com/tearsecurity/firstorder">https://github.com/tearsecurity/firstorder</a><br/>

Conclusion<br/>
So as a result, defense mechanisms are evolving to something smarter, something better. Maybe in future, signature based apporoaches will be totally abondoned. And there is a high probability that machine learning based defense mechanisms will be cheaper and wider than today. So, attackers should also evolve in this way. We need to find smarter ways to mislead artificial intelligence.</body></html>
