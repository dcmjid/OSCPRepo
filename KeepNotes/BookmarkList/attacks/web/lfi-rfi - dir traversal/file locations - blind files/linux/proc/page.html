</head><body>/proc/crypto&#09;&#09;, a list of available cryptographic modules<br/>
/proc/devices&#09;&#09;, a list of character and block devices sorted by device ID but giving the major part of the /dev name too<br/>
/proc/diskstats&#09;, giving some information (including device numbers) for each of the logical disk devices<br/>
/proc/filesystems&#09;, a list of the file systems supported by the kernel at the time of listing<br/>
/proc/interrupts&#09;, /proc/iomem, /proc/ioports and the directory /proc/irq, giving some self-explanatory details about the devices (physical or logical) using the various system resources<br/>
/proc/kmsg&#09;&#09;, holding messages output by the kernel[6]<br/>
/proc/meminfo&#09;, containing a summary of how the kernel is managing its memory.<br/>
/proc/modules&#09;&#09;, one of the most important files in /proc, containing a list of the kernel modules currently loaded . It gives some indication (not always entirely correct) of dependencies.<br/>
/proc/mounts&#09;&#09;, a symlink to self/mounts which contains a list of the currently mounted devices and their mount points (and which file system is in use and what mount options are in use).<br/>
/proc/net/&#09;&#09;, a directory containing useful information about the network stack, in particular /proc/net/nf_conntrack, which lists existing network connections (particularly useful for tracking routing when iptables FORWARD is used to redirect network connections)<br/>
/proc/partitions&#09;, a list of the device-numbers, their size and /dev names which the kernel has identified as existing partitions<br/>
/proc/scsi&#09;&#09;, giving information about any devices connected via a SCSI or RAID controller<br/>
a symbolic link to the current (traversing) process at /proc/self (i.e. /proc/PID/ where PID is that of the current process).<br/>
/proc/slabinfo&#09;&#09;, listing statistics on the caches for frequently-used objects in the Linux kernel<br/>
/proc/swaps&#09;&#09;, a list of the active swap partitions, their various sizes and priorities<br/>
Access to dynamically-configurable kernel options under /proc/sys. Under /proc/sys appear directories representing the areas of kernel, containing readable and writable virtual files.<br/>
For example&#09;&#09;, a commonly referenced virtual file is /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward, because it is necessary for routing firewalls or tunnels. The file contains either a '1' or a '0': if it is 1, the IPv4 stack forwards packets not meant for the local host, if it is 0 then it does not.<br/>
/proc/sysvipc&#09;&#09;, containing memory-sharing and inter-process communication (IPC) information.<br/>
/proc/tty&#09;&#09;&#09;, containing information about the current terminals; /proc/tty/driver looks to be[original research?] a list of the different types of tty available - each of which is a list of those of each type<br/>
/proc/uptime&#09;&#09;, the length of time the kernel has been running since boot and spent in idle mode (both in seconds)<br/>
/proc/version&#09;&#09;, containing the Linux kernel version, distribution number, gcc version number (used to build the kernel) and any other pertinent information relating to the version of the kernel currently running<br/>
other files depending on various hardware, module configurations, and changes to the kernel.</body></html>
