<title>Testing For ShellShock</title>
</head><body>The template starts out with the magic string:<br/>
() { :; }; <br/>
<br/>
Note that spaces are required. When not sanitized, the string essentially creates a function and passes it to bash. Execution is obtained by placing your commands at the end of the string. <br/>
() { :; }; /bin/sleep 10<br/>
<br/>
It is recommended to use full paths when testing due to edge cases. Also make sure to test for blind execution. <br/>
<br/>
Typically, anything being passed to the server should be tested for this string. Web application-specific testing can usually be started by injecting EVERY header. At minimum, make sure to test for injection in the following:<br/>
Hhost:<br/>
User-Agent:<br/>
Accept-Language:<br/>
Cookie:<br/>
Referer:<br/>
<br/>
And feel free to add more. Nmap's shellshock nse will also generate a header like:<br/>
() { :; }; /bin/sleep 10: () { :; }; /bin/sleep 10<br/>
<br/>
but this can error out some webservers and return false positives (ie 403 errors or such)</body></html>
