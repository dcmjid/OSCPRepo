<title>CWD In PATH</title>
</head><body>Abusing users with '.' in their PATH:<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately users and sometimes admins are lazy - its human nature to want to avoid taking unnecessary steps, in this case the user would rather type:<br/>
<br/>
$ program <br/>
instead of<br/>
$ ./program<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
Newbie Note: <br/>
Having '.' in your PATH means that the user is able to execute binaries/ scripts from the current directory.<br/>

<br/>
To avoid having to enter those two extra characters every time, the user adds '.' to their PATH. This can be an excellent method for an attacker to escalate his/ her privilege, for example:<br/>
<br/>
Joe (the attacker) happens to know that that Suzy has sudo privileges to change users passwords - unfortunately for the admins she also has the power to change the root password. Now Suzy is a lazy girl and thus has '.' in her PATH. Joe places a program called 'ls' in a directory Suzy often visits. This 'ls' program contains code to modify root's password. Now when Suzy enters that directory and asks for a listing, because she has '.' in her path, the 'ls' that Joe placed in the directory is run, instead of /bin/ls. Now root's password has been changed, and Joe is able to logon as root.<br/>
<br/>
Having '.' in your PATH can also help the attacker if exploiting programs that make system(), execvp(), or execlp() calls to programs, if they do not specify the full path to the program the attacker can place a program into a directory in the PATH, so that program is run instead - this works because programmers just expect that the program they mean to run will be in the PATH.<br/>
<br/>

Newbie Note:<br/>
To add '.' to your path type this at the prompt PATH=.:${PATH} then to be able to use the '.' in your path enter export PATH.<br/>

Countermeasures:<br/>
1) Do not include '.' in your path!<br/>
2) Place the following at the end of your .bashrc or .profile - This will remove all occurrences of '.' in your PATH.<br/>
PATH=`echo $PATH | sed -e 's/::/:/g; s/:.:/:/g; s/:.$//; s/^://'`<br/>
