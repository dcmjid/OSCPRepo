<title>IFS Hijacking</title>
</head><body>IFS Exploit:<br/>
<br/>
The IFS exploit is pretty straight forward, although to the beginner it may seem a tad confusing. The IFS (or Internal Field Separator) is used to separate words/ arguments etc. In the English language we use the ' ' (space) character to seperate arguments from their commands.<br/>
<br/>
With an IFS set to ' ' (space) the command "ls -al" has the space between 'ls' and '-al' to separate the command to its argument.<br/>
<br/>
With an IFS set to ';' (semicolon) the command "ls;-al" will have the same effect as "ls -al", because we have said we wish to use the ';' instead of the space. So it uses a ';' to separate the command from its argument.<br/>
<br/>
A hacker can make practical use of the IFS to escalate his/ her privilege. For example: Lets say that at every logon a suid program (/usr/bin/date) executes /bin/date and displays the output on screen. An attacker can take advantage of this by doing the following (I will explain the workings of the privilege elevation after, I have numbered the lines to make the explanation easier) (the '$' is the symbol for a standard command prompt, and the '#' is symbol for the root command prompt).<br/>
<br/>
1)&#09;$ cat /home/nick/bin<br/>
2)&#09;...#!/bin/bash<br/>
3)&#09;.../bin/sh #this script will execute /bin/sh<br/>
4)&#09;$ ls -al /usr/local/date<br/>
5)&#09;---s--x--x 1 root root 21673 Mar 9 18:36 date<br/>
6)&#09;$ PATH=/home/nick:${PATH}<br/>
7)&#09;$ export PATH<br/>
8)&#09;$ IFS=/<br/>
9)&#09;$ export IFS<br/>
10)&#09;$ /usr/local/date<br/>
11)&#09;# whoami<br/>
12)&#09;root<br/>
<br/>
I will now explain the above in detail:<br/>
Lines 1, 2, 3: the attacker creates a simple bash script that runs /bin/sh when executed.<br/>
Lines 4 and 5: the attacker checks the permissions for the suid program that calls /bin/date.<br/>
Lines 6 and 7: adds '/home/nick' to his PATH (where the 'bin' program is he wrote earlier).<br/>
Lines 8 and 9: He sets the IFS to '/' this means that instead of using a space, the '/' will be used, this<br/>
means that the program instead of calling '/bin/date' will call 'bin date', because he has placed a<br/>
program called 'bin' in the home directory (which is now in the PATH) when /usr/local/date is executed<br/>
it will execute /home/nick/bin with the permissions of /usr/local/date - which means the <br/>
attacker will get a root shell!<br/>
Lines 11, 12: The attacker runs 'whoami' to verify that he is root, line 12 confirms this.<br/>
<br/>

************<br/>
Countermeasures: An easy way of attempting to stop IFS exploits, is to not allow users to execute any type of executable or suid programs in places that the users can write to. Directories such as /home/[username] and /tmp allow the user write permissions, this means that they can create programs then run them from the location. If directories such as /home and /tmp are on their own partitions you can disallow users to run suid programs or any executables for that matter by adding the correct options to /etc/fstab. You can do this by replacing a line similar to this:<br/>
<br/>
/dev/hda6 /tmp ext3 defaults 0 0<br/>
with this:<br/>
/dev/hda6 /tmp ext3 nosuid,noexec 0 0<br/>
<br/>
This type of countermeasure is not only useful to stop IFS attacks - but pretty much all attacks concerned with privilege escalation discussed in this manual<br/>
