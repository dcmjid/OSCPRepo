<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Sometimes deep packet inspection will stop simple tunneling (ie noticing HTTP going through an SSH connection). Traffic Encapsulation can help fool/bypass this. <br/>
<br/>

HTTPTunnel<br/>
stunnel<br/>
<br/>
These tools usually work in a client/server model and can encapsulate any protocol within their respective tunnels. </body></html>
