If you want to analyze cookies from an auth request, capture the login request and send to sequencer<br/>
<br/>
Try = for sql statement injection. If you know a key exists (like admin for username) try to make something close enough to admin to be recognized as admin<br/>
admin &nbsp; &nbsp;(with spaces)<br/>
admin=<br/>
cdmin<br/>
bdmin<br/>
etc<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to try is bit flipping in Burp with the auth cookie<br/>
Say you register cdmin. If you can manage to 'flip a bit' maybe the application can recognize you as admin. "close enough" right?<br/>

Encryption and Padding....Try oracle padding issues<br/>
Allows brute forcing one byte at a time: padbuster.pl<br/>
8 or 16 for BlockSize<br/>
<br/>
GDB disassemble binary to find out what's going on, what calls are being made<br/>
In this case, it is cat /etc/shadow<br/>
cat is not bad itself, but there is not a full path here...can you take over the path to cat?<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:usr/bin<br/>
how about editing your path? <ul><li style="list-style-type: none">export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH</li>
</ul>
