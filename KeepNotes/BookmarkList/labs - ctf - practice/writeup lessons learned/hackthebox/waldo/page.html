<br/>
Web is easy enough with a web proxy. <br/>
Take the time to throw EVERY list payload in the background while researching other methods of bypass. <br/>
<br/>
Enumeration is key for priv esc. Especially in Docker containers, may not be looking for root right away. Find other ways into low priv access. <br/>
Don't spend too much time analyzing binaries. Maybe 30 minutes top. Most of the "CTF" machines will have "obvious" ways of moving on.<br/>
<br/>
LinEnum is fantastic. If you don't know about why something is being flagged, research it. <br/>
Even if something seems simple and "couldn't possibly work" try it anyway. You never know what you may find.</body></html>
